# Instructions
Clone the design patterns project from GitLab and add the following patterns:

* Create one unit test showing how to implement and use each of the following design patterns:
* Creational Patterns: Abstract Factory, Prototype.
* Structural Patterns: Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Fa√ßade.
* Behavioral Patterns: Null Object, Observer, Strategy, Template Method.

This means there is a total of 11 unit tests in your test class.

Don't push the changes to this project, instead create your own remote personal repository using your Avantica account and ask the Avantica Trainers to review your work.
